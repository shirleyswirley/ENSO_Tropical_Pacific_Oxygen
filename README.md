Reproduces figures and tables in the following paper:
<br>Leung et al. (2019).

Please cite the above paper if you use this code.

This code was written using MATLAB 9.0.0.341360 (R2016a).

How to run:
1. Download this repository.
2. Download data from http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2648124. Place it in a folder called "data" within this downloaded repository's folder.
3. To recreate the figures and tables from the above paper, simply start up MATLAB and run the scripts: runall_globalgridded.m, runall_tropicalpacificonly.m, and runall_rawprofs.m in turn. Each of these scripts creates a different subset of the figures and tables in the paper. Read the comment blocks at the top of each script to see which figures/tables each script will generate.
